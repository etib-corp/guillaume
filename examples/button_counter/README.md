# Button Counter

An interactive example demonstrating event handling and state management in Guillaume.

## What it demonstrates

- Multiple button components with different behaviors
- Event handling and callback functions
- State management and UI updates
- Component interaction and data flow

## Building

From the main Guillaume directory:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running

```bash
./examples/button_counter/button_counter
```

## Features

The example creates:

- A title label
- A counter display showing the current count
- Three buttons: Increment, Decrement, and Reset
- Automatic UI updates when the counter value changes

The example demonstrates how button clicks trigger state changes and cause the UI to re-render with updated information.
