# Contribute to Guillaume

## Introduction

We aims at making Guillaume a open-source tool in order to make your XR projects in the easiliest way.

But in order to do this, we have to have a high code quality and some articulated processes.

## Code conventions

Please read [this document](docs/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md) about our code conventions.

## Commit conventions

We are mainly based on [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)'s convention. So please take a look and we have reproduced a [summary here](docs/COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md).

## Pull Request process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Write tests for your changes
5. Run tests
6. Submit a pull request

Please make sure that your code follows the code conventions and that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## How to make an issue

> First of all, use the template issue provided when creating a new issue.

When you create an issue, please provide as much information as possible. This includes:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the problem or feature request
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- Any relevant screenshots or logs

Do not:

- Create duplicate issues
- Create issues that are not related to the project
- Use inappropriate language
- Be disrespectful to other contributors
- Ignore the issue template

## How to document your code

We use [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) to document our code. Please follow the guidelines below when documenting your code:

- Use Doxygen comments to document functions, classes, and modules
- Provide clear and concise descriptions
- Use appropriate tags (e.g., \@param, \@return) to describe function parameters and return values
- Keep the documentation up to date with code changes

Please, while coding some wizardry, remember to document it well so that others (and yourself) can understand it later.

We are ok with copilot usage for documentation but please make sure to review and edit the generated comments as needed.
