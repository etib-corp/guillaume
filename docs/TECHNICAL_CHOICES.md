# Technical Choices

This document outlines the key technical choices made in the development of this project, including programming languages, libraries, and tools used.

## Programming Languages

We have chosen `C++20` as the **primary** programming language for this project due to its performance, efficiency, and control over system resources. C++ is well-suited for applications that require high performance and low-level memory management.

We could have chosen using *Java* (regarding technologies we have chosen) but it is less efficient and only android devices oriented, but we want to target more different type of devices.

With this programing language, we have chosen these libraries.

## Libraries

## Build System

We have chosen CMake as our build system
